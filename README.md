#Project 1 = is a multiple linear regression looking at Fantasy football stats for WR from 2021. I did a regression between Age, Fumbles, and Targets per game compared to Fantasy Points per game. 

#P1 Insights = I found no significance with age, but minor significance with Fumbles and Targets. For Project two, I plan to plot the results.
